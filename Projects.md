<h3><a href="https://inoliao.github.io/CoachAI/" target="_blank">TrackNet: A Deep Learning Network for Tracking High-speed and Tiny Objects in Sport Applications</a></h3>
<div align="justify">
Ball trajectory data are one of the most fundamental and useful information in the evaluation of players' performance and analysis of game strategies. Although vision-based object tracking techniques have been developed to analyze sport competition videos, it is still challenging to recognize and position a high-speed and tiny ball accurately. In this work, we develop a deep learning network, called TrackNet, to track the badminton from broadcast videos in which the ball images are small, blurry, and sometimes with afterimage tracks or even invisible. The proposed heatmap-based deep learning network is trained to not only recognize the ball image from a single frame but also learn flying patterns from consecutive frames. TrackNet takes images with the size of 640x360 to generate a detection heatmap from several consecutive frames to position the ball and achieve high precision even on public domain videos. The network is evaluated on the video of 2018 Indonesia Open Final - TAI Tzu Ying vs CHEN YuFei. The precision, recall, and F1-measure of TrackNet reach 85.0%, 57.7%, and 68.7%, respectively.

<h3><a href="https://inoliao.github.io/nbaWebsite/" target="_blank">NBA Game Prediction System</a></h3>
<div align="justify">
Predicting NBA games is not an easy task. Conventional data analysis and statistic approaches are usually complicated and the accuracy is not high. In this work, a machine learning based method is proposed and the complete design flow is thoroughly introduced and explained. 8 single-stage machine learning models are trained and compared. More complex composite models such as voting mechanism and stacking method are also designed and elaborated. The proposed model reaches 76.8% accuracy on predicting all 2018 NBA playoffs. Furthermore, for the Eastern Conference Final, Western Conference Finals, and Conference Finals, our model achieves an extraordinary prediction accuracy of 85.7%, 71.4%, and 100%, respectively.
