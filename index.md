<h3>Biography</h3>
<p align="justify">
I am I-No Liao, currently a research assistant in Advanced Database System Lab, Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University. My research focus is on large-scale image information retrieval, visual recognition, and deep learning. I am particularly keen on using artificial intelligence to enhance professional sports analysis so as to assist athletes in augmenting both on-court performance and off-court training. In addition, I am also interested in database systems design, parallel programming, and web development.
